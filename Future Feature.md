To-Do List for Game Enhancements

[ ] Font Styling:
Details: Choose a visually appealing and legible font that fits the game's theme. Implement font loading with error handling to gracefully fall back to a default font if the chosen font is missing. Consider font size, color, and potential bold/italic variations.
Effort: Low to Medium. Requires downloading a font file, placing it in the correct directory, updating the code to load the font, and adjusting font settings. The level of effort depends on how complex you want the styling to be (e.g., just changing the font family vs. implementing different styles).
Dependencies: Requires a .ttf font file.
Files to Modify: config.py, main.py
[ ] Video/Trailer Before Welcome Screen:
Details: Display an MP4 video trailer before the welcome screen, using st.video() or HTML embedding. Consider autoplay, looping, muting, and controls. Optimize the video for web delivery.
Effort: Low to Medium. Requires adding the video file to your project, updating the code to display the video using one of the methods described earlier, and adjusting video player settings.
Dependencies: An MP4 video file.
Files to Modify: streamlit_app.py
[ ] A Proper Game Over/Completed High Scores Screen:
Details: Design a visually appealing game over screen that displays the player's score, time taken (if applicable), and a message indicating whether the player won or lost. Implement high score saving and display a high scores table.
Effort: Medium. Requires creating the UI elements for the game over screen, implementing the logic to save and load high scores, and displaying the high scores table. You already have some of the basic logic in place, so it's mostly about improving the UI.
Dependencies: Potentially a CSS file for styling the game over screen.
Files to Modify: streamlit_app.py
[ ] A Video/Trailer for the Next Level at the End (After Game Over/Completion):
Details: Show a short video clip or trailer teasing the next level or future content after the player has either completed the game successfully or triggered a game over (assuming you plan to add levels or content).
Effort: Low to Medium. Similar to the welcome screen video. You'd reuse the video display logic (either st.video() or HTML embedding) and conditionally display the video based on the game over/completion status.
Dependencies: An MP4 video file.
Files to Modify: streamlit_app.py
[ ] A Credits Scene/Video:
Details: Create a credits scene (either a scrolling text list or a video) listing the developers, artists, and anyone else who contributed to the game. Make it accessible from the main menu or the game over screen.
Effort: Low to Medium. Requires creating the credits content (text or video) and implementing the logic to display it. A scrolling text list is simpler to implement than a video.
Dependencies: Credits content (text file, image, or video).
Files to Modify: streamlit_app.py
Overall Feasibility:

The checklist is definitely achievable. The level of effort for each item is manageable, and you already have a solid foundation to build upon. The most time-consuming aspects will likely be designing the UI elements for the game over screen and creating the video content (trailers and credits).

Tips for Tackling the To-Do List:

Prioritize: Decide which features are most important to you and tackle them first.
Break It Down: Break each item down into smaller, more manageable tasks.
Test Frequently: Test your changes frequently to catch errors early.
Version Control: Use Git (or another version control system) to track your changes.
Iterate: Don't be afraid to experiment and iterate on your designs.
